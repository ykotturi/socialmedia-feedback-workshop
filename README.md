## Workshop overview

While the shift to on-demand labor may foster greater control over one’s employment in some ways, it has removed much of the benefits that come with consistently working in shared physical spaces. Working in physical spaces allow opportunities for social support, earning, long-term growth, and stability. The goal of this workshop is to facilitate a discussion around how physical spaces and online technologies influence each other in on-demand work (e.g. ridesharing, crowd work, freelancing, side hustles). We plan to invite a diversity of stakeholders, including grassroots organizers who can represent and voice the concerns of their respective worker communities, researchers studying these topics, and designers of on-demand work platforms. Discussion and ideas generated from this workshop will be archived online and made available to the larger research community and the general public.

She builds software tools to help amateur and professional creators (crafters, designers, makers) receive effective feedback throughout their design process. Last summer at Etsy, she investigated how thousands of Etsy sellers (based in the U.S., U.K., and India) organically leverage their peers to navigate the many uncertainties that arise in digitally-mediated work. With Community Forge, a co-working space in Wilkinsburg, PA, she is working to offer training courses on computer literacy and digital labor platforms to strengthen employability within the local community.
