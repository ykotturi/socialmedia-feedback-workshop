## Workshop overview

This workshop is for crafters, makers, or product designers, for how to get effective feedback from your social media and ultimately grow your small business.

This workshop is intended for those who do not have a formal background in design or the arts (i.e. "amateur designers"), however, we welcome those with any background (self-taught, formal training, no training). 

Workshop activities will involve a series of individual reflections and group-based worked, where pariticipants will be asked to reflect on and share their unique experiences as crafters, designers, makers. Participants will be asked to beta-test software systems we are building, give preliminary feedback, as well as shape future direction of these software systems.
